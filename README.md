neo4j - Spring - Eclipse - Kickstart!
=====================================

Ok…setting up a simple neo4j standalone project is pretty straightforward…but quite frequently there are some old fashioned Java-Spring-Dinosaurs trying to create "the perfect Eclipse project" enabling these guys to do everything within their IDE. And then you usually end up in POM-hunting, applicationContext.xml-tuning, web.xml modifications etc. and tudaloo: a few hours have passed until you lean back and finally start focusing on your Java services instead of configuring your project/IDE…

This project is dedicated to all Java-Dinos who want to start coding immediately, simply follow the steps below and you can start coding in about five minutes…time's running now!

Environment
-------------------------------------
* Eclipse 4.2 (J2EE IDE including Web Tools Platform etc.)
* Spring IDE Eclipse Plugin 3.2
* Maven 3.04, somewhere around on my Mac
